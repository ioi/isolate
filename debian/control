Description: A sandbox for programming contests
  Isolate is a sandbox built to safely run untrusted executables, like
  programs submitted by competitors in a programming contest. Isolate
  gives them a limited-access environment, preventing them from affecting
  the host system. It takes advantage of features specific to the Linux
  kernel, like namespaces and control groups.
