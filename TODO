- Make --inherit-fds accept a list of fd's to inherit

- use /etc/subuid for the UID range
- but still allow to configure maximum number of sandboxes
  less than the size of the range, so that CPU / node
  restrictions cannot be bypassed

- Daemon:
	- quota option on init
	- logging
	- make socket permissions configurable
	- clean all boxes on init
