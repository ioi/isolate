- Make --inherit-fds accept a list of fd's to inherit

- use /etc/subuid for the UID range
- but still allow to configure maximum number of sandboxes
  less than the size of the range, so that CPU / node
  restrictions cannot be bypassed

- Manual: Do not enable swap
- Manual: memory.peak requires kernel 5.19

- check that /proc/sys/core_pattern does not contain a pipe

- reference the grader security paper

- FIXME: setting "cgroup.subtree_control"
